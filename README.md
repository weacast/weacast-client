> _Important:_ `weacast-client` will not evolve anymore (see discussion [here](https://github.com/weacast/weacast-client/issues/6)) and will only be maintained for the purpose of our [demo application](https://github.com/weacast/weacast). If you'd like to build client applications using Weacast you'd better have a look to our client API layer in https://github.com/weacast/weacast-core and dedicated map engine modules like https://github.com/weacast/weacast-leaflet.
